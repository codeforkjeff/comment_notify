This is a fork of comment_notify module for Drupal 7. The webpage for
the original project is <http://drupal.org/project/comment_notify>

I created this to apply some patches that the maintainers haven't
gotten around to doing yet. Some are my own, some are from others. See
below for details. 

Use this software at your own risk. I make no guarantees as to whether
it will make your server explode.

Forked on Mar 10, 2010.
